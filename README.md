This project was designed to help boot camp students understand the dynamics of working as a team on a group project. The project also serves to help boot camp students apply their knowledge about HTML, Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), JavaScript, server-side API's, and GitHub to the project, in a manner which creates a working webpage.

While completing this project we learned how to utilize URLs in JavaScript in a faster and more efficient way. We also learned the importance of understanding the requirements of a project, while making sure each requirement was addressed with each task which was completed.
